## About
A flailing attempt at making a game!

Based on my [vite+wasm](https://github.com/VoidedName/voideds-lazy-wasm-template/tree/main) template

Hosted here [Flailing TCG](https://voidedname.github.io/rust-tcg/)

## How to install
**!Important**: WASM-PACK (with default features) requires a perl installation.

Using a windows system, a viable perl version can be found here https://strawberryperl.com/

Alternatively, you can disable the default features of wasm-pack. (Feature openssl-sys has the perl dependency)

* `npm i` to install all the npm stuff
* `npm run dev` to start up vites dev server
* `npm run build` will build this piece of art :)
